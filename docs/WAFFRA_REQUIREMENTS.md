## WAFFRA-NEW-001 — Detailed acceptance contract

**User screenshot (2026-11-06):** Current green balance card shows the account name (`مصرف الإنماء - الإنماء باي`) at its top; a second dropdown with the same truncated name appears on the bottom-right and overlaps the illustration. User explicitly rejected this placement.

1. Replace the bank/account heading **inside** the green balance card with a tappable **account selector** in exactly the heading area (upper central area). For `All accounts / كل الحسابات`, the same selector shows that full label. Preserve a single picker, remove the bottom-right floating picker.
2. Show the **entire** selected provider/account name, even if very long. No `TextOverflow.ellipsis`, no fixed `maxLines:1`, no `maxWidth:156` that cuts names. Wrap onto multiple lines and size the card/control/layout to content. Keep the arrow visible and the whole control tappable.
3. Do not overlap the amount, privacy-eye, illustration/wave, comparison badge, surrounding cards, or the collapsing balance header. Support RTL, LTR, narrow devices and font scaling.
4. Keep verified account selection and all-account balance/metrics filtering unchanged. Do not alter financial amounts, SQLCipher storage/authorities, transaction linking, or the mandatory source-account rule.
5. Add Flutter widget/layout/regression coverage for long/short Arabic and English account names, multiple text scales, picker open/select, visible full text, no second picker and no overflow; verify actual Android UI before marking Done.

**Current source anchor:** `lib/main.dart`, class `WaffraBalanceHeader`; the top heading is `WaffraText(heading...maxLines:1)`; the bottom picker has key `m470-balance-account-picker`, positioned at `right:10,bottom:10`, constrained to `maxWidth:156`, `maxLines:1` with ellipsis. This is a documentation-only initial commit.

**Tracking:** Issue [#401](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/401); implementation [PR #402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402). **Status: Recorded / Not implemented.**


## 2026-11-06 — SMS review → financial posting screenshot batch

**Issues #403–#411 / WAFFRA-NEW-002…010:** registered before coding in [draft PR #402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Observed:** The 276 SAR top-up SMS goes to an empty manual entry form; after saving, details falsely show 'إدخال يدوي' with no original SMS; first bank account form does not preselect sender/suffix; message disappears from editing context when Back is pressed and the confirmed SMS remains pending. Source screenshots stay with the user, without copying bank recipients or private full SMS to GitHub.

### WAFFRA-NEW-002 — SMS review → entry: prefill title, amount, type, main/subcategory

**Issue:** [#403](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/403) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** Use the scanned SMS facts to prepopulate operation title, actual SAR amount, expense/income type, date, matched main and subcategory; example 276 SAR phone top-up. Editable suggestions; uncertain fields must be reviewed, no fabricated category or fee/principal swap.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

### WAFFRA-NEW-003 — Preserve SMS source and protected original instead of mislabeling manual

**Issue:** [#404](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/404) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** Persist immutable SMS ID/hash, sender and secure original reference even if the user edits the SMS-derived entry with the manual-style editor. Transaction details must say bank SMS reviewed and confirmed by user, not independent manual entry or no original SMS.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

### WAFFRA-NEW-004 — Preselect new financial-account institution from the sender

**Issue:** [#405](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/405) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** First scanned SMS from confirmed sender e.g. AlinmaPay suggests/prefills its matching provider/institution in Add Account. User confirms correct institutional identity and supplies child-account data. No automatic money posting or unverified provider binding.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

### WAFFRA-NEW-005 — Allow adding custom account subtype, not only listed presets

**Issue:** [#406](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/406) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** Offer 'إضافة نوع حساب' in the new account type/subtype dropdown; validate and persist custom type for later reuse without bypassing trusted bank/wallet/cash accounting classifications.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

### WAFFRA-NEW-006 — Prepopulate verified masked last-four in child account creation

**Issue:** [#407](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/407) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** Derive correct source/destination account suffix (e.g. ••••8308) from reviewed message, prefill child account suffix, user confirms; never use an unrelated recipient, phone number, 4-digit OTP, fee or amount.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

### WAFFRA-NEW-007 — Reuse trusted sender and last-four to select child account next time

**Issue:** [#408](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/408) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** Remember approved provider and unique child account mapping from sender plus masked account suffix/direction. Subsequent SMS suggests/chooses verified matching account, asks when ambiguous, never inherits Home filter or blindly trusts sender name.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

### WAFFRA-NEW-008 — Keep full readable original SMS accessible while reviewing and editing

**Issue:** [#409](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/409) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** Show sender, date and full read-only original SMS in both review and entry, with safe mixed Arabic/English/number direction and OTP redaction; user must not navigate back to retrieve message text.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

### WAFFRA-NEW-009 — Back navigates exactly one step, preserves SMS draft/context

**Issue:** [#410](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/410) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** Sender list → message review → editor → account selection/creation uses correct Android/dialog back stack; back returns to previous step, not Home, preserving draft, message and review-scroll context.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

### WAFFRA-NEW-010 — Remove successfully posted SMS from pending; dedupe and rollback

**Issue:** [#411](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/411) · **PR:** [#402](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/pull/402).

**Acceptance:** After verified commit of income, expense or transfer, mark exact reviewed SMS ID/hash recorded, remove from pending view and refresh counts. If save fails/cancels keep review row/draft. Preserve original for audit; prevent duplicate records/charges/rescans.

**Validation:** targeted Flutter/widget source checks, actual signed Android screenshots and end-to-end flow, SQLCipher verified-writer/deduplication tests where applicable. Preserve existing M470 rules and current `main` behavior.

**Status: Recorded / Not implemented.** Existing historical fixes may partially cover this item; check behavior rather than inferring completion from committed source.

**Non-regression invariant:** No accidental automatic transaction posting, no sender-only trusted account selection, no default from Home header; all newly posted money entries require the user-confirmed financial account. On failure, retain draft and pending state; after success, remove only the correctly identified SMS from pending and preserve encrypted provenance.
