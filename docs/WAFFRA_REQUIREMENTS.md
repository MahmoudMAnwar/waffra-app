| WAFFRA-NEW-001 | Home balance card: replace top bank/account heading with its account dropdown; remove floating lower dropdown; show full long names without truncation and avoid overlaps | [#401](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/401) | **New draft PR on `feat/waffra-new-001-home-account-selector-20261106`** (link after PR creation) | **Recorded / Not implemented** | Not yet committed or tested |

## WAFFRA-NEW-001 — Detailed acceptance contract

**User screenshot (2026-11-06):** Current green balance card shows the account name (`مصرف الإنماء - الإنماء باي`) at its top; a second dropdown with the same truncated name appears on the bottom-right and overlaps the illustration. User explicitly rejected this placement.

1. Replace the bank/account heading **inside** the green balance card with a tappable **account selector** in exactly the heading area (upper central area). For `All accounts / كل الحسابات`, the same selector shows that full label. Preserve a single picker, remove the bottom-right floating picker.
2. Show the **entire** selected provider/account name, even if very long. No `TextOverflow.ellipsis`, no fixed `maxLines:1`, no `maxWidth:156` that cuts names. Wrap onto multiple lines and size the card/control/layout to content. Keep the arrow visible and the whole control tappable.
3. Do not overlap the amount, privacy-eye, illustration/wave, comparison badge, surrounding cards, or the collapsing balance header. Support RTL, LTR, narrow devices and font scaling.
4. Keep verified account selection and all-account balance/metrics filtering unchanged. Do not alter financial amounts, SQLCipher storage/authorities, transaction linking, or the mandatory source-account rule.
5. Add Flutter widget/layout/regression coverage for long/short Arabic and English account names, multiple text scales, picker open/select, visible full text, no second picker and no overflow; verify actual Android UI before marking Done.

**Current source anchor:** `lib/main.dart`, class `WaffraBalanceHeader`; the top heading is `WaffraText(heading...maxLines:1)`; the bottom picker has key `m470-balance-account-picker`, positioned at `right:10,bottom:10`, constrained to `maxWidth:156`, `maxLines:1` with ellipsis. This is a documentation-only initial commit.

**Tracking:** Issue [#401](https://github.com/MahmoudMAnwar/waffra-app/issues/401); implementation PR link to be inserted when created. **Status: Recorded / Not implemented.**
